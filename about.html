                        <p class="card-text">Online applications are playing an important role in our day to day life from online shopping to doctor booking which is saving time and helping ineffective management of resources. As of now, there are no applications for online doctor appointments for veterinary systems. It has features for booking an online appointment by checking the availability of a doctor and then select specific doctor specialization and a form is shown to the user who will fill the form based on animal condition and symptoms and after that do online or offline payment. Bookings are confirmed by admin and updates are sent to the doctor regarding booking along with details the user has filled.A prerequisite to the development of an efficient animal health, food safety and traceability 
                            management system in the animal food production chain is the implementation of an integrated 
                            veterinary website management capable for the capture, storage, analysis and retrieval of data 
                            and providing the opportunity for the cumulative gathering of the knowledge and capability for 
                            its competent interpretation. Such a system will enable collecting appropriate data, including 
                            quality management and inspection controls, from all establishments and commodities in the 
                            farm to food production chain (farms, holdings, slaughterhouses, laboratories, traders etc.) in a 
                            structured, predefined format, and facilitate competent analyses and reporting of such data, as 
                            well as the improvement of the existing programs and strategies. The role of information system 
                            in animal disease diagnosis, surveillance and notification, control of national and international 
                            trade of commodities, food safety management, investigation of diseases, predictive 
                            microbiology and quantitative risk assessment is of great importance for the quality of veterinary 
                            service. Integral part of the veterinary website management is animal disease notification system 
                            designed according to and in compliance with international requirements, standards and 
                            recommendation and able to exchange relevant information with similar information systems. 
                            The aim of this contribution is to describe national animal disease notification system. A system 
                            for management of a veterinary clinic. To make easier the administration of clients, employees, 
                            consultation (animal care), services and products. Providing the following basic features: 
                            animals, owners and employees registration, services and products maintenance also 
                            management of the consults.</p>
